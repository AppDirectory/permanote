# Permanote Description

Permanote is a simple note taking application.

Features:

- markdown for note editing
- syntax highlighting for code snippets
- drag and drop image uploading
- copy and paste image uploading
- tagging
- full text search

The application is designed for Sandstorm so there is no authentication.

Also there is no concept of 'notebooks'. Simply create a new Sandstorm Grain for each new notebook that you want.
