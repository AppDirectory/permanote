# PermaNote

A personal note taking application.

This is very alpha at the moment while I get it working on Sandstorm. More details to follow.

## Warning and help appreciated

This was hacked together over a weekend. The code is horrible in many places! Pull requests gratefully received if you'd like to clean anything up.

### Charles Leifer

A lot of the code for this application was lifted directly from this blog post by Charles Leifer: <http://charlesleifer.com/blog/how-to-make-a-flask-blog-in-one-hour-or-less/>

Many thanks to Charles for his helpful blog posts and for creating excellent support for SQLite with his Peewee ORM. This makes an excellent choice for developing Sandstorm apps.

### Logo

The dolphin logo is from the Twitter twemoji collection: https://github.com/twitter/twemoji

**Why a dolphin for the logo?** Evernote use and elephant because they are known to have good memories. Apparently [dolphins have even better memories](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130806-dolphins-memories-animals-science-longest/)
