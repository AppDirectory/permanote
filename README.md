# PermaNote

A personal note taking application.

This is very alpha at the moment while I get it working on Sandstorm. More details to follow.

See description.md for features.

## Warning and help appreciated

This was hacked together over a weekend. The code is horrible in many places! Pull requests gratefull received if you'd like to clean anything up.

## Credits

A lot of the code for this application was lifted directly from this blog post by Charles Leifer: <http://charlesleifer.com/blog/how-to-make-a-flask-blog-in-one-hour-or-less/>

Many thanks to Charles for his helpful posts and for creating excellent support for SQLite with his Peewee ORM. This makes an excellent choice for developing Sandstorm apps.
