# Permanote

A personal note-taking application.

The app is functional and works on Sandstorm. There are a number of feature improvements planned that will be listed here soon.

Since the app is designed to run on [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) it [doesn't implement user accounts or access control](https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/handbook/#does-not-implement-user-accounts-or-access-control).

## Warning and help appreciated

This was hacked together over a weekend. The code is horrible in many places! Pull requests gratefully received if you'd like to clean anything up.

### Charles Leifer

A lot of the code for this application was lifted directly from this blog post by Charles Leifer: <http://charlesleifer.com/blog/how-to-make-a-flask-blog-in-one-hour-or-less/>

Many thanks to Charles for his helpful blog posts and for creating excellent support for SQLite with his Peewee ORM. This makes an excellent choice for developing Sandstorm apps.

### Logo

The dolphin logo is from the Twitter twemoji collection: https://github.com/twitter/twemoji

**Why a dolphin for the logo?** Evernote use an elephant for their logo because elephants are known to have good memories.

Apparently [dolphins have even better memories](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130806-dolphins-memories-animals-science-longest/)
